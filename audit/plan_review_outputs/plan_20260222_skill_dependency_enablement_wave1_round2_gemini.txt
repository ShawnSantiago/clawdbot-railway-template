To ensure strict adherence to the project's governance policies, I will perform a plan review for `plan_20260222_skill_dependency_enablement_wave1`.

The plan correctly adheres to the confidence constraints (all scores $\le 6$) mandated by the partial status of `integrations.md`. The wave-based execution strategy is sound for minimizing disruption, and the reliance on `/data` for persistence matches the Railway runtime constraints.

Here is the structured review output:

```json

  "review_id": "review_20260222_skill_dependency_enablement_wave1_gemini",
  "plan_id": "plan_20260222_skill_dependency_enablement_wave1",

  "status": "approved",
  "reviewer": "gemini",
  "feedback": "The plan is robust and well-aligned with Railway's ephemeral file system constraints by targeting `/data`. The explicit exclusion of Darwin-only skills prevents wasted effort. \n\nRecommendations to incorporate during execution:\n1. **Architecture Detection:** In Step 1 & 2, ensure the bootstrap script explicitly detects the host architecture (`x86_64` vs `aarch64`) to download the correct binaries, as relying on generic names may fail.\n2. **Resource Constraints:** For Wave 3 (Go binaries), strongly prefer downloading prebuilt release artifacts over compiling from source (`go install ...`) to avoid OOM kills or timeouts during the startup phase on smaller Railway service plans.\n3. **Rate Limits:** Avoid hitting GitHub APIs for 'latest' release resolution during every boot. Pin versions in the matrix (Step 1) and use direct download URLs to bypass API rate limits.",
  "required_actions": [
    "Ensure Step 1 matrix includes column for 'Architecture Support' or logic to handle arch-specific URLs.",
    "Update Step 2 logic to use pinned versions for all downloads, avoiding dynamic resolution during startup."
